🔭 I’m currently working on  
Final-year Software & Data Engineering coursework and projects — building Spring Boot backends and modern frontends with a focus on data integrity.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on  
Full‑stack web apps, backend services, and data‑engineering tasks (Spring Boot, Angular/React, PostgreSQL, Neo4j).

🤝 I’m looking for help with  
Mentorship on system design and observability, feedback on portfolio polish, and deployment best practices.

🌱 I’m currently learning  
Distributed systems & observability, graph data modeling (Neo4j), advanced SQL, and backend scalability patterns.

💬 Ask me about  
Java & Spring Boot backends, REST API design, JPA/Hibernate, PostgreSQL transactional integrity, and building simple frontends with Angular/React.
